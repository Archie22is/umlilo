# Umlilo

Umlili is WordPress theme built on [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/), by [Zurb](http://zurb.com/).

Big props go to [drewsymo](http://drewsymo.github.com/) for his work on the [Foundation for WordPress](https://github.com/drewsymo/Foundation) theme. Umlilo was originally forked from the FWP repository and based mostly on [Infrastrukt](https://github.com/rediris/infrastrukt) theme.

The theme features a resource loader, which will allow you to either load your CSS & JS files locally or via CDN. Everything else will be added as desired by the developer - no support is offered, but fee free to use and report any bugs you may encounter.
